<p>I am a PhD student of Astronomy at the <a href="http://www.dfa.unipd.it/">Department of Physics and Astronomy "Galileo Galilei"</a> at the University of Padova.</p>
<p>I focus my research study on the detection, validation, and characterization of Extrasolar planets (aka, Exoplanets), which are defined as planetary bodies outside our Solar System.</p>
