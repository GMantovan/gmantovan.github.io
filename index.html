      <h1> About me </h1><p>I am an astronomy Research Fellow at the <a href="http://cisas.unipd.it/">Centro di Ateneo di Studi e Attivit√† Spaziali "Giuseppe Colombo" - CISAS</a> of the University of Padova, Italy.</p><p>My research cover several critical areas in the field of <strong>exoplanets</strong>, which are defined as planetary bodies outside our Solar System. I am an expert in validating candidate exoplanets identified with the transit method, which is a crucial step to identify genuine exoplanets and exclude false positives among the plethora of transiting candidates. My expertise extends to the confirmation and characterisation of single- and multi-planet systems, expecially those younger than 1 Gyr.</p><p>I am a keen <strong>programmer</strong> and am always willing to learn a new programming language; I am currently doing my research in Python. I also spend some time doing astronomic observations, mainly at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). </p>
