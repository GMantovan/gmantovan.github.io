<p>I am a PhD student of Astronomy at the <a href="http://www.dfa.unipd.it/">Department of Physics and Astronomy "Galileo Galilei"</a> at the University of Padova.</p>
<p>I focus my research study on the detection, <strong>validation</strong>, and characterization of Extrasolar planets (aka, <strong>Exoplanets</strong>), which are defined as planetary bodies outside our Solar System.</p>

<p>I am keen on <strong>programming</strong> and I am always ready to learn a new programming languange; for now, I do my research using Python. I also like to do astronomic observations. </p>
