<p>My research interests span multiple topics in the field of Extrasolar planets, but they all focus on solving the same humankind mystery: Are we alone? </p><p><h3>Validation of Extrasolar planets</h3>One of the main methods to detect an Extrasolar planet (aka, Exoplanets) - and identify its radius - is the transit method. This technique is an indirect method by which we observe a periodic dip in the host star's luminosity due to the transit of a planet in front of the host star. However, the geometric probability of finding a planetary transit is low and requires us to monitor many stars in the sky. All this is possible thanks to space-based surveys, such as the Kepler mission or the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which respectively began and continued the era of statistical analysis of exoplanets allowing us to detect thousands of them. </p>
