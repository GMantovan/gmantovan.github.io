<p>My research interests span multiple topics in the field of Extrasolar planets, but they all focus on solving the same humankind mystery: Are we alone? </p><p><h3>Validation of Extrasolar planets</h3>One of the main methods to detect an Extrasolar planet (aka, Exoplanet) - and identify its radius - is the <strong>transit method</strong>. This technique is an indirect method by which we observe a periodic dip in the host star's luminosity due to the transit of a planet in front of the host star. However, the geometric probability of finding a planetary transit is low and requires us to monitor many stars in the sky. All this is possible thanks to space-based surveys, such as the Kepler mission or the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which respectively began and continued the era of statistical analysis of exoplanets allowing us to detect thousands of them. </p><p>Despite this, a percentage of objects initially identified as <strong>candidate</strong> exoplanets by the Kepler mission <i>before</i> and by TESS <i>now</i> turned out to be <strong>false positives</strong> (FPs). An FP is an astrophysical object that simulates a planetary transit, such as a binary star system in which the two components undergo mutual eclipses. In all this, the <strong>validation</strong> process is, therefore, that fundamental part that aims to identify false positives and exclude them, leading to the final confirmation of an exoplanet candidate thanks to the contribution of other techniques that allow us to obtain the exoplanet mass.  </p>
