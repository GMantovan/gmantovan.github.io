<p>My research interests span multiple topics in the field of Extrasolar planets, but they all focus on solving the same humankind mystery: Are we alone? </p><p><h3>Validation of Extrasolar planets</h3>One of the main methods to detect an Extrasolar planet -- and identify its radius -- is the transit method. This technique is an indirect method by which we observe a periodic dip in the host star's luminosity due to the transit of a planet in front of its host star. Unfortunately, the geometric probability of finding a planetary transit is low; therefore, to find thousands of exoplanets and start the era of statistical analysis, it is necessary to monitor many stars. All this is possible thanks to space-based surveys, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). </p>
